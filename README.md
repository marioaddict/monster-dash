*Up for a little endurance match?*

Looks like Boyfriend has once again found himself called out to an unfamiliar location and challenged to a rap battle. This time, his challenger is some kind of zombie girl named Marelia, and she wants to see how he handles a song much longer than usual... just over *9 minutes* long, in fact!

Features one new song: **ENDURANCE**

How long can you hold out?
